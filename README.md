# Image-Processing-Laboratory-Projects
## Overview:
This repository contains a collection of laboratory projects developed for the *Image Processing* course, taught by Prof. Coloma Ballester, within the Audiovisual Systems Engineering Degree. The work was carried out by Xavier Riera and Pau Noguera throughout the course.
The objective of the course is to understand and implement the fundamental processes involved in digital image acquisition and processing, from the formation of an image in the human visual system to advanced techniques for analysis, enhancement, and interpretation of visual information.

## Repository Structure:
The repository is organized into six laboratory folders, one per lab assignment. Where each folder contains:
- Input images and datasets.
- PDF report describing the theoretical background, methodology, and results.
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) developed and executed using Google Colab, containing the full implementation and visual results.
Each lab focuses on a specific block of the course content and includes visualizations, quantitative analysis, and discussion of results.

## Lab 1 - Color Spaces and Basic Image Processing:
This laboratory introduces image processing using Python, with a focus on color representation and manipulation. The work explores different color spaces, implements a sepia filter, performs skin detection, and computes the average image from a set of inputs. The lab provides a foundation for understanding how color information is represented and processed in digital images.

## Lab 2 – Spatial and Frequency Domain Processing:
This lab studies the relationship between the spatial domain and the frequency domain through the Fourier Transform and its applications. Tasks include image denoising, subsampling, and image rotation using the Yaroslavski method. The lab highlights how frequency-based techniques can be used to analyze and manipulate image content.

## Lab 3 – Contrast Enhancement and Quantization:
The focus of this laboratory is on contrast manipulation and image quality analysis. Both linear and nonlinear contrast transformations are implemented, along with histogram equalization. The lab also introduces image entropy, quantization, and quantitative fidelity criteria, providing tools to evaluate the impact of processing operations on image quality.

## Lab 4 – Mathematical Morphology and Filtering:
This lab explores mathematical morphology and its applications to image analysis. It combines non-morphological linear filters with morphological operators, emphasizing both theory and practice. The laboratory includes background segmentation and the use of morphological gradients to extract structural information from images.

## Lab 5 – Texture Analysis and Synthesis:
In this laboratory, texture is analyzed and synthesized using frequency-based and statistical methods. The work studies the magnitude and phase of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), applies Random Phase Noise (RPN), and implements Efros and Leung’s texture synthesis algorithm. The lab demonstrates how textures can be modeled and generated from example images.

## Lab 6 – Image Segmentation with Deep Learning:
This lab introduces image segmentation using deep learning. A simple Autoencoder-based model (U-Net architecture) is implemented and trained to segment pet images from the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset. Starting from a provided baseline model, the lab explains the code structure and training process, with the objective of improving the predicted segmentation masks so they closely match the ground-truth annotations.
